## MaaS Potential Users' Profiles Characterization with a K-means Clustering Algorithm (2023)
**作者**: Aguiar, Iago and Monzon, Andres and {Lopez-Carreiro}, Iria

**摘要**:

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is building its way into cities all across the globe to change how their residents move around today. Given the user-centric nature of this model, it is essential to understand individuals' needs and expectations for its successful deployment. The paper explores different potential users' profiles in the metropolitan area of Madrid (Spain) by applying a machine learning clustering algorithm. Our analysis reveals three clusters in terms of individuals' willingness to adopt MaaS: the MaaS-enthusiasts'', who are significantly open to embrace the new mobility solution; the innovation doubtful users'', who are likely to adopt MaaS but need more persuasive incentives; and the anti-new technologies'', a group averse to innovation. Tailored strategies are defined to foster MaaS within these three groups, with the goal of encouraging more sustainable behaviours. Our results demonstrate how machine learning can be helpful to transport planners and policymakers for getting insightful information from large datasets.

**作者**: Alonso-Gonz'alez, Mar'ia J. and {Hoogendoorn-Lanser}, Sascha and {van Oort}, Niels and Cats, Oded and Hoogendoorn, Serge

**摘要**:

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is expected to significantly change mobility patterns, yet it is still not clear who will embrace this new mobility paradigm and how MaaS will impact passengers' transportation. In the paper, we identify factors relevant for MaaS adoption based on a survey comprised of over thousand respondents in the Netherlands. We find five clusters in relation to individuals' inclinations to adopt MaaS in the context of urban mobility. We characterize each of the clusters, allowing for the examining of different customer segments regarding MaaS. The cluster with the highest inclination for future MaaS adoption is also the largest cluster (representing one third of respondents). Individuals in this cluster have multimodal weekly mobility patterns. On the contrary, current unimodal car users are the least likely to adopt MaaS. We identify high (mobility) ownership need and low technology adoption (present in three of the five clusters) as the main barriers that can hinder MaaS adoption. Policies that directly address these two barriers can stimulate MaaS adoption.

## Mobility as a Service and Sustainable Travel Behaviour: {{A}} Thematic Analysis Study},

**摘要**:

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a novel brand of transport that promises to replace private cars with multimodal personalised mobility packages enabled by a digital platform capable of integrating travel planning, booking and ticketing, and real-time information services. It is an intervention that through its digitisation, connectivity, information and sharing merits intends to inspire and support the transition to a more sustainable mobility paradigm. Recent research suggests, however, that the potential uptake of MaaS might not be overwhelming; current car drivers could face considerable difficulties in bypassing their personal car for it and, more worryingly, future MaaS users may substitute not only personal car trips but also public transport journeys with car-sharing and ride-sharing services. This means that MaaS might not be able to create travel behaviour change, and even if it does, the changes may not be always towards the right direction. Through conducting 40 semi-structured interviews in three different UK cities, namely London, Birmingham and Huddersfield, and employing a robust Thematic Analysis approach, this study explores the factors underpinning the uptake and potential success of MaaS as a sustainable travel mechanism. The challenges and opportunities reflecting and affecting potential for responsible MaaS usage refer to five core themes Car Dependence; Trust; Human Element Externalities; Value; and Cost, each of them with distinctive and diverse dimensions. Policy-makers and mobility providers should realise that MaaS success relies on changing people's attitudes to private cars (something very challenging) and thus they should incentivise responsible MaaS use, promote public transport as its backbone, use public engagement exercises and trials to expose people to the concept and somewhat demonise private car ownership and car use.

## Application of Crowdsourced Data to Infer User Satisfaction with Mobility as a Service MaaS (2022)
**作者**: Aman, Javad Jomehpour Chahar and {Smith-Colin}, Janille

**摘要**:

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a user-centric concept that integrates transportation services, and offers a multimodal journey planner, and online booking and payment options into a single digital platform. Achieving the goal of MaaS, which is to promote sustainable forms of transportation and reduce single occupancy vehicle travel, depends on the needs of different user groups. A review of literature confirms that little remains known about gender-based perspectives towards MaaS. This study aims to identify the features that impact satisfaction across gender. After collecting over 29,000 online reviews, series of text mining and unsupervised machine learning technique were performed to extract features discussed by users in the reviews. Next, ordinal logit regression was used to examine associations between extracted features and level of satisfaction. Findings show that public transit is still the backbone of MaaS, as such, other modes of transportation such as micromobility and ridesharing still receive little attention from users. Although, integrated payment options and booking systems were meant to offer MaaS an advantage over classic journey planners, still fare related features were found to contribute to user dissatisfaction. App related features (such as map, technical issues, and updates), often neglected in transportation studies, showed significant association with satisfaction. One of the main contributions of this study is the expanded understanding of gendered attitudes towards MaaS. Few studies have explored gender perspectives towards new mobility concepts, and particularly MaaS. Increased understanding of gendered perspectives encourages the use of MaaS, and ultimately enhances travel experiences for all users.

**摘要**:

Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is a new way to understand mobility, which integrates services such as car-sharing, bike-sharing, public transport, etc. Its goal is that mobility requirements be no longer fulfilled by privately owning mobility resources, but by requesting them on-demand. In this paper we considered the willingness to adopt MaaS services, choices between different kinds of MaaS subscriptions as well as the choice between MaaS and private vehicle ownership by means of two choice-experiments, address simultaneously on the basis of an hybrid-choice modeling (HCM) framework. The results show that the willingness to adopt MaaS is greatly influenced by the socio-demographic characteristics of the individuals, while the willingness-to-pay for different mobility services within MaaS subscriptions lies below the current prices paid for those services individually. However, the willingness-to-pay exhibits a large variation across individuals indicating that MaaS may be interesting for specific user groups.

**摘要**:

There is a growing demand, across the globe, for smart mobility solutions to reduce negative social, environmental and economic externalities of private automobile travel. Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is an integrated system that through a single online interface enables commuters to plan, book, and pay for trips which utilise a range of mobility providers. MaaS has a unique characteristic to provide a system into which new service options can be integrated with traditional transportation modes. This makes MaaS a potential alternative to private vehicle ownership, and a means to overcome some of the negative externalities associated with automobile dependency. To realise this potential, many cities have implemented---or are in the process of implementing---MaaS trials to better understand how this service will function within cities. This paper utilises a systematic literature review to extract insights, and develops a conceptual framework to identify barriers and risks related to MaaS adoption in cities. The study findings reveal that: (a) the desired MaaS outcomes are associated with reduced vehicle kilometres travelled, increased trip awareness, reduced parking, reduced vehicle ownership, and improved social equity; (b) MaaS supply side barriers include public private cooperation, business support, service coverage, shared vision, and data and cyber security; (c) MaaS demand side barriers are its lack of appeal to older generations, public transport users, and private vehicle users, the attractiveness of the digital platform, and user willingness-to-pay.

**摘要**:

In recent decades cities have applied a number of policy measures aimed at reducing car use and increasing public transportation (PT) patronage. Persuasive strategies to change mobility behavior present notable limitations in economic and logistical terms and have only minor impacts. The smartphone has emerged as a promising tool to overcome these challenges, as it can host persuasion strategies through mobility apps. Simultaneously, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) schemes could open up new possibilities for addressing both sustainability goals and the needs of urban travelers. This paper carries out a literature review to identify the key elements of mobility apps that foster more sustainable travelers' choices. The findings show that some persuasive strategies such as eco-feedback, rewards or social challenges are effective because they are well received by users. From the users' point of view, the perceived barriers (e.g., usability, privacy) relate negatively to app adoption, and it is considered useful to include functional needs such as real-time information (e.g., to avoid congestion), cost savings (e.g., customized multimodal packages), comfort (e.g., crowding on public transport) or health (e.g., calories burned). We have found that a proper design of multimodal travel packages based on (i) financial incentives and (ii) environmental awareness, could help increase public transport patronage and reduce private car use.

**作者**: Cisterna, Carolina and Madani, Negarsadat and Bandiera, Claudia and Viti, Francesco and Cools, Mario

**摘要**:

Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) system is regarded as one of the emerging solutions to offer integrated, seamless, and flexible multi-modal mobility services as an alternative to privately owned mobility resources. MaaS is expected to change the way users will choose their modes of transport to reach their daily activities, and how service providers will generate profits, cooperate, and compete. To successfully deploy MaaS to reach the intended goals, it is critical to develop feasible and sustainable models that capture the diverse needs of customers as well as the diverse and often competing objectives of service providers. This paper aims to provide a general modelling framework and a critical and descriptive analysis of the relevant literature relating all main actors in the MaaS ecosystem, and identify and discuss all factors that are considered relevant, focusing on the actor's decision-making processes and their correlations. This review shows the large variety and interaction of factors influencing MaaS adoption and their impact on forecasting MaaS appeal. It is also observed that current travel behaviour and multi-modal transport models are not fully capturing the diverse travel needs and choices of potential MaaS users. Recent advancements in agent-based simulation and discrete choice modelling offer potential solutions to address this gap, and future research should aim in that direction. Finally, the review analyses the interaction between MaaS actors, including customers, service providers, the government, and the MaaS Broker, highlighting the complexity of the modelling process comprising all actors of the MaaS ecosystem. Therefore, it is recommended to prioritise future research in exploring these areas.

  shorttitle = {Predicting {{Mobility}} as a {{Service}} ({{MaaS}}) Use for Different Trip Categories (2022)
**作者**: Duan, Sophia Xiaoxia and Tay, Richard and Molla, Alemayehu and Deng, Hepu

**摘要**:

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has gained popularity as a means of sustainable urban transport which makes the understanding of MaaS use critical for its design and promotion. Studies have contributed to the growing understanding of MaaS, its design features, and consumers' willingness to pay for MaaS in general, without recourse to the differences in traveling for work, social and general purposes. This paper develops and tests models to predict MaaS use by applying artificial neural network analysis, following the cross industry standard process and data mining framework. It also estimates separate models for social, general, and work trips, using 33 input variables reflecting network externality, transaction cost, behaviour, institutional, environmental concern, personal travel, and socio-economic factors. Data are collected from a survey of 331 Australians. The study reveals different sets of socio-economic factors, the impact of Covid-19, and personal travel factors as key predictors of MaaS use for general, social, and work trips with an average prediction accuracy of 68\%, 68\%, and 75\% respectively. The findings can be used to inform strategies and policies on how to attract a user base with respect to socio-economic and personal travel factors for promoting MaaS use.

**摘要**:

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a new transport concept which integrates, manages, and distributes private and public mobility alternatives by using intelligent digital technologies. Recently, research and implementations have been widely conducted. In order to reveal future implications, it is crucial to analyze the available MaaS services by using systematic methodology. Cluster analysis was applied to create typical groups of MaaS services and to define the common features of the systems, which may highlight future trends. In order to identify the most relevant MaaS initiatives, the typical parameters of the services were taken into account and a dataset was developed. More than 30 MaaS services from 14 countries were investigated, and the features and the functionalities of these services were analyzed. The findings demonstrate that there is potential for the development of the applications in terms of their payment features, their personalization, and the provision of all attainable elements of MaaS. The number of operators is constantly increasing. However, it is uncertain whether public or private MaaS operators will be dominant on the market. Three cluster groups were created with specific features and directions of development. The Route planners group involves a few modes of transport, but it provides an extensive service. While the Third parties group has primarily private MaaS operators, the Public systems group usually includes public MaaS operators. This comprehensive study might be useful to MaaS operators and regulators for understanding the typical features and the development directions of the market.

**摘要**:

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a recent innovative transport concept, anticipated to induce significant changes in the current transport practices. However, there is ambiguity surrounding the concept; it is uncertain what are the core characteristics of MaaS and in which way they can be addressed. Further, there is a lack of an assessment framework to classify their unique characteristics in a systematic manner, even though several MaaS schemes have been implemented around the world. In this study, we define this set of attributes through a literature review, which is then used to describe selected MaaS schemes and existing applications. We also examine the potential implications of the identified core characteristics of the service on the following three areas of transport practices: travel demand modelling, supply-side analysis and business model design. Finally, we propose the necessary enhancements needed to deliver such an innovative service like MaaS, by establishing the state of art in those fields.

## Individuals among Commuters : Building Personalised Transport Information Services from Fare Collection Systems, shorttitle Individuals among Commuters (2013)
**作者**: Lathia, Neal and Smith, Chris and Froehlich, Jon and Capra, Licia

**摘要**:

This work investigates how data from public transport fare collection systems can be used to analyse travellers' behaviour, and transform travel information systems that urban residents use to navigate their city into personalised and dynamic systems that cater for each passenger's unique needs. In particular, we show how fare collection data can be used to identify behavioural differences between passengers: we thus advocate for a personalised approach to delivering transport related information to travellers. To demonstrate the potential for personalisation we compute trip time estimates that more accurately reflect the travel habits of each passenger. We propose a number of algorithms for personalised trip time estimations, and empirically demonstrate that these approaches outperform both a non-personalised baseline computed from the data, as well as published travel times as currently offered by the transport authority. Furthermore, we show how to easily scale the system by pre-clustering travellers. We close by outlining the wide variety of applications and services that may be fuelled by fare collection data.

## Risky Choice and Diminishing Sensitivity in {{MaaS}} Context: {{A}} Nonlinear Logit Analysis of Traveler Behavior},
  shorttitle = {Risky Choice and Diminishing Sensitivity in {{MaaS}} Context (2024)
**作者**: Liu, Jianing and Jian, Sisi and Wu, Chenyang and Dixit, Vinayak

**摘要**:

In the rapidly transforming landscape of urban transportation, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has emerged as a potentially transformative solution to adapt to fluctuating travel demand. However, despite arguments in the literature suggesting that uncertainty in travel plans may influence travelers' preferences for MaaS, the extent and mechanisms of this impact remain relatively underexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by evaluating travelers' preferences toward MaaS subscriptions, mode choices, and their reactions to uncertainty within a risky-choice modeling framework. We incorporate a linear-specified benchmark model and two nonlinear models (one based on Expected Utility Theory with Constant Absolute Risk Aversion adjustments, and the other on Prospect Theory), to estimate travelers' risk perceptions and their valuation of gains and losses associated with travel time and costs caused by occasional activities during commute trips. The data utilized in our study originates from a specifically designed stated preference survey carried out in Hong Kong. Our findings present insightful observations into MaaS bundle configurations, socio-demographic patterns, and notably, behaviors under uncertain circumstances. In the face of uncertainty, we observe a noticeable increase in reluctance to adopt MaaS, and a heightened preference for taxis. The models also underscore significant risk aversion and diminishing sensitivity concerning travel time and cost, with these tendencies proving more pronounced for travel time compared to cost. These insights are valuable for policymakers and MaaS operators, offering an enhanced understanding of users' risk attitudes and the intricate interplay between travelers' preferences for MaaS and the uncertainties inherent in daily travel.

## Framework for the Potential Userbase of Mobility as a Service (2021)
**作者**: Loubser, Jansen and Marnewick, Annliz{\'e} L. and Joseph, Nazeer

**摘要**:

When a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) implementation is planned, the potential userbase must be understood to determine the service potential. The characteristics and travel behaviour of the potential users to estimate the userbase for a MaaS service is not well understood. Additionally, studies in the developing country context are limited. This research has developed a framework to derive an understanding of the potential userbase using population as well as travel mode perspectives with a focus on developing countries. The framework was developed through literature to better understand the characteristics of a potential MaaS user to evaluate the potential userbase. The population perspective includes socio-demographic factors, subjective attitudes and perceptions and environmental considerations of a developing country MaaS user. The perspective of the travel mode includes travel demand and travel mode characteristics of a typical MaaS user. The framework was cross-validated with pilot MaaS studies to affirm and expand the various characteristics presented. Furthermore, a practical implementation of the framework was discussed to aid potential developing country MaaS operators and transport planners to understand the potential userbase for MaaS and to evaluate its potential success.

## 多元交通行動服務使用者之套票購買行為分析－{{以高雄市MaaS系統為例} (2023)
**作者**: Lu, Chung-Cheng and Chien, Yu-Shyun and Chou, Shiang-Chung and Wu, Tung-Ling and Chen, Siang-Jie

**摘要**:

Mobility as a service (MaaS) is an emerging concept in recent years, and it has been promoted in many cities around the world. Understanding users' purchase behavior of MaaS packages will help the authorities and operators to promote MaaS. This study develops a package-purchasing prediction model using data mining techniques. The prediction model is built and trained using the data of membership registration, package-purchasing records and iPASS card transit-ridership records of MaaS users in Kaohsiung. Through preliminary data processing and analysis, it is found that significant imbalance exists in MaaS users' package-purchasing records for the different plans, and the imbalance may affect the prediction results of the model. To address this issue, the study proposes an oversampling method, namely probability distribution-based over-sampling (PDB), to generate additional samples. This method is first tested and compared with the SMOTE (synthetic minority over-sampling technique) method commonly used in the literature by using datasets published online, and it is found that the proposed method is significantly better than the SMOTE method. Then the study uses the method to balance the MaaS users' package-purchasing data, and constructs a decision tree model and a support vector machine model for MaaS users' package-purchasing prediction. Through cross-validation test results, it is found that the models constructed by the oversampling data using the simulation method has good prediction results which shows that the prediction model has the ability to predict the users' purchase behavior. This study also discusses the branch variables in the decision tree model, and found that the user's monthly spending on each public transportation mode will affect the package-purchasing of MaaS users. Moreover, month is also an important variable. The results can be used as a reference for MaaS operators to take appropriate actions on marketing based on the results of the users' package-purchasing prediction.

**作者**: Matowicki, Michal and Pecherkova, Pavla and Amorim, Marco and Kern, Mira and Motzer, Nicolaj and Pribyl, Ondrej

**摘要**:

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive survey involving a substantial sample size (n = 6,405) of urban daily commuters across four European nations (Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Czech Republic). Our investigation contributes to an enriched comprehension of the user dynamics associated with Mobility-as-a-Service alternatives and their interrelation with public transit modalities in the context of travel preferences. Specifically, we researched the responsiveness of participants to variations in pricing and travel durations. Additionally, we examine the tendencies of various participant categories, stratified into distinct segments based on shared attributes, toward the adoption of public transportation, MaaS solutions, or private vehicular transport. Our findings highlight the essential role fundamental mobility determinants, such as price and travel time, play in influencing the likelihood of opting for a specific transportation modality. This phenomenon was particularly discernible within the "Unspecified Users" group, which gives us options to alter their behavior. The analytical framework used in our study that combined several mathematical modeling tools provided insight into the choices people make when choosing between different travel options, and our findings may be used by decision makers to create better and more informed approaches to promote sustainable alternatives to the use of cars in urban settings.

## Opportunities and Barriers to Multimodal Cities: Lessons Learned from in-Depth Interviews about Attitudes towards Mobility as a Service},
  shorttitle = {Opportunities and Barriers to Multimodal Cities (2020)
**作者**: Matyas, Melinda

**摘要**:

With the emergence of the Mobility as a Service (MaaS) concept, it is important to understand whether it has the potential to support behaviour change and the shift away from private vehicle ownership and use. This paper aims to identify potential ways that MaaS (specifically MaaS plans) could help encourage behavioural change; and understand the barriers to using alternative transport modes. In-depth interviews and qualitative analysis are applied to the case study of London. The results indicate that individuals segment the transport modes offered via MaaS into three categories: essential, considered and excluded. Soft measures should target each individuals' consideration set as this is where the most impact can be made regarding behaviour change. Respondents also highlighted factors that make them apprehensive towards certain modes, such as safety, service characteristics and administration. Interventions that focus on the socio-demographic groups that are most affected could help make these modes more appealing.

  shorttitle = {Trying {{Out Mobility}} as a {{Service} (2016)
**作者**: Sochor, Jana and Karlsson, I. C. MariAnne and Str{\"o}mberg, Helena

**摘要**:

The concept of mobility as a service (MaaS) has been proposed as a feasible way to achieve more sustainable transport. One example of such a service is UbiGo, a broker service for everyday urban travel developed and evaluated within the Go:Smart project in Gothenburg, Sweden. This paper presents evidence of travel behavior and related changes from a 6-month field operational test (FOT), during which 195 participants tested the new service. On the basis of the responses to participant questionnaires and interviews and the information recorded in travel diaries, change-enabling service attributes were identified. Such attributes included the transportation smorgasbord concept, simplicity, improved access and flexibility, and economy. Although not a service attribute per se, the FOT also enabled the new behaviors to be evaluated in a trial and a reevaluation of convenience. The broader implications of the findings of the FOT to obtain an understanding of travelers' new choices and behaviors for the future design of MaaS are discussed. Service design and demand are not independent of each other, and if a mobility service is to change behavior (i.e., achieve an impact) as well as create added value, these goals need to drive design decisions and the deliberate, conscious development of service dimensions, such as customization, bundling, and the range of the offer. On the basis of the experiences gained, the authors emphasize the need for a more holistic and flexible perspective on mobility (and the design perspective on mobility services) that is focused on serving users' needs and that involves capitalizing on synergies between public and private actors to develop the MaaS offer and better meet the urban mobility challenge ahead.

## Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS): A Latent Class Cluster Analysis to Identify Dutch Vehicle Owners' Use Intention, shorttitle = Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) (2023)
**作者**: van 't Veer, Renske and Annema, Jan Anne and Araghi, Yashar and {Homem de Almeida Correia}, Gon{\c c}alo and {van Wee}, Bert

**摘要**:

A restructuring of the current mobility and transportation system seems to be inescapable, as a result of the increasing urbanization and challenges regarding global sustainability. The concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is regarded by policy-makers as an answer to the needed change. Generally speaking, MaaS is an online platform that enables users to plan, book and pay a trip out of a variety of transport modes, conventional and shared. However, in the literature, the potential impact of MaaS on mobility is still relatively unclear. This study, therefore, aims to provide insights into which factors influence the intention to use MaaS among private vehicle owners, who have until now been identified as relatively MaaS-averse travellers. Policy-makers are highly interested in this group to start using MaaS since their shift from private vehicles to other transport options might positively contribute to easing the congestion and environmental problems. In order to create some insights on possible travel behavioural shift and adoption of new systems, an empirical study has been conducted among (co--)owners of motorized vehicles (passenger car, electric passenger car, van, motorcycle; moped) that live in the Netherlands. The survey was based on a conceptual model that explains why people would use this new system (MaaS) and has asked respondents about their travel behaviour, socio-economic characteristics and attitudes towards MaaS. Using Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) five clusters in the sample population regarding the intention to use MaaS were identified. The cluster profiles show that private vehicle owners who often use public transport and active modes are most inclined to use MaaS, whereas the `conservative' passenger car owners who use the car as their main mode of transport for all their trips (e.g. commuting, leisure) show a lower intention to use MaaS. As it can be expected that the societal benefits of MaaS will especially occur when these conservative car owners adopt MaaS, we conclude that, from a policy perspective, implementing MaaS could be less effective in reducing transport externalities (e.g. pollution and wasted time in congestion) as perhaps expected.
