The core value of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) lies in integrating various transportation systems to provide users with a seamless and convenient travel experience, promoting the concept of "access over ownership" to reduce dependence on private vehicles. This study utilizes electronic ticketing data from MeNGo, a MaaS system in Kaohsiung City, and applies feature engineering, principal component analysis (PCA), K-Means++ clustering, and a multinomial logit model (MNL) to analyze the public transportation usage behavior of MaaS users.

A total of 32 trip features representing different dimensions of user travel behavior were extracted from approximately 4 million transaction records, distilled into five principal behavioral components to characterize travel patterns. Through unsupervised learning methods, eight distinct user clusters were identified and further categorized into two primary groups based on usage frequency: commuters (long-distance commuters, short-distance commuters, high-transfer commuters, and multi-purpose users) and non-commuters (mixed-mode users, occasional weekday/weekend users, and one-time users). The results indicate that usage frequency and spatiotemporal regularity are critical differentiators between the two main groups. Specifically, commuters exhibit a strong preference for stable-frequency transit systems such as the metro, demonstrating highly regular spatial and temporal travel patterns. In contrast, non-commuters display more diverse and dispersed transportation choices. Furthermore, this study utilized effect size analyses to rigorously evaluate significant behavioral differences among user clusters, and the multinomial logit model further validated the influence of station characteristics and individual attributes on commuter behavior.

The primary contribution of this research is the development of a comprehensive processing framework for MaaS users' electronic ticket data, the extraction of five major behavioral dimensions of public transport usage, and the profiling of eight distinct user clusters. These findings provide valuable insights for designing targeted MaaS ticket packages and enhancing public transportation network planning. Nevertheless, this research faces limitations due to incomplete data regarding bus/shared transport origins and destinations, as well as users' socio-economic characteristics. Future research should supplement these data sources to deepen understanding of user behavior. Policy recommendations from this study include differentiating MaaS ticket packages based on user characteristics, enhancing bus network coverage to improve feeder connectivity to the metro, and strengthening inter-agency data integration and openness to further optimize MaaS systems and subsequent user behavior analyses.
